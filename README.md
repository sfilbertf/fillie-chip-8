FillieChip8!

A CHIP-8 emulator (or I know, I know, interpreter) written in C++ using SDL, OpenGL and Dear ImGui.

To use, compile using make, then:

./bin [ROM] [Opcodes per Frame]

There is a hanging dependency (you have to install SDL mixer, preferrably using a built-in package manager) since I was too lazy to update the makefile.

Cheers!
